# Cloud Engineering Blueprint

This repository serves as a comprehensive blueprint for cloud engineering projects. It includes infrastructure as code (IaC) configurations, application code, documentation, and CI/CD workflow files.

## Project Structure

- `app/`: Contains application code and Docker configuration.
  - `src/`: Holds the main application code (e.g., `main.py` for a Python Flask app).
  - `Dockerfile`: Used to containerize the application.

- `terraform/`: Stores IaC definitions using Terraform.
  - `main.tf`: Defines AWS resources such as VPC, ECS/EC2, and ECR.
  - `variables.tf`: Contains variable definitions.
  - `outputs.tf`: Outputs relevant information about the infrastructure.

- `.github/workflows/`: Contains GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD.
  - `ci-cd.yaml`: Defines the CI/CD pipeline.

- `docs/`: Includes documentation such as architecture diagrams and explanations.
  - `architecture.md`: Provides an overview of the AWS architecture and CI/CD workflow.

## Usage Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LabXIII/Cloud-Engineering-Blueprint-x1.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Cloud-Engineering-Blueprint-x1
   ```

3. Build and run the application using Docker:
   ```bash
   cd app
   docker build -t cloud-engineer-app .
   docker run -p 5000:5000 cloud-engineer-app
   ```

4. Deploy the infrastructure using Terraform:
   ```bash
   cd terraform
   terraform init
   terraform apply
   ```
